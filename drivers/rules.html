        <strong>NOTICE:</strong>
        Please make sure to report your incidents after a race otherwise we can not award correct penalties or remove any wrongly awarded penalties.
        We are not able to review each perspective for a whole race, as this would take a huge amount of time (all admins are volunteers). 
        We highly recommend that you record your POV during the race or save the full race replay and create clips, so the process is easier for you and for the admins.

            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Reserves drivers will get seat before race (instead of drivers who haven't done registration and who won't race).</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Available reserves will be rotated through and put into cars by admins.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Full time drivers who haven't done registration will be awarded with 1 penalty point.</li>

        <h3 class="content-heading" >Qualifying</h3>
        <ul style="padding-left:15px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px">
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">In qualifying, if you have finished your laps and want to retire it is mandatory to retire it in the pits after you finished your lap, otherwise, penalties will be applied.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">You must make sure not to run out of fuel during qualifying, as this can cause issues for other racers.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Impeding cars which are on their qualifying lap will lead to penalties being applied.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Please take care when re-joining the track, causing an incident will lead to penalties.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">If you arrive late to qualifying you will not be able to set a lap. If you do this will lead to penalties being applied.</li>

        <h3 class="content-heading" >Race Rules</h3>
        <ul style="padding-left:15px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px">
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Remember when setting up your race strategy at the start of the race, please do not ready up instantly to allow all drivers to set up!</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Keep racing clean and avoid contact with other drivers. If you do make contact this will likely result in a penalty for either party, unless it is deemed a racing incident.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">It is generally accepted that you follow standard F1 rules unless otherwise stated.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Resetting your car onto the track is strictly forbidden. Some exceptions may apply in extreme circumstances (e.g.: stuck sideways in the castle section in Baku and unable to get out) otherwise a penalty will be applied.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Sitting in AI mode for more than 5 seconds at any point in the race, including particularly a safety car, is strictly forbidden except for extreme circumstances. We do this as this has previously caused issues with the lobby and/or the safety car.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Dangerous driving or misconduct during a safety car or formation lap, will lead to penalties points and potentially a time penalty if you disrupt another driver's race.</li><br>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">If a driver gets an illegal overtake then please assess the situation and do not come to a sudden stop, if you show that you did try to give the position back but the game gave you a penalty, you can appeal it.</li><br>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">When the game shows you the blue flag, you have been caught up by a car on a lap ahead of you. When being lapped, it is your responsibility to let the leaders through safely at the earliest opportunity, without blocking them.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">If you have been lapped and are clearly faster than a car that is a lap ahead, then you are allowed to unlap yourself. If you cannot gap the car you are unlapping yourself from then you must allow them to have free air.</li><br>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">While the race is in progress you will be penalized if you retire the car anywhere on track. If you need to leave the race for any reason it is mandatory to retire the car in the pits, not doing this will cause a penalty.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">If connection is lost while racing, you are able to join back, failure to rejoin without reason may lead to penalty points.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Please take care when re-joining the track, causing an incident will lead to penalties.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">When a safety car or VSC has been deployed. Drivers must do their best to stick to the delta. Drivers found to be driving unnecessary slow on safety car restarts or during the VSC (for example, being 4+ seconds positive on the delta) may receive penalty points.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">DRS chicken is forbidden if there are more than 2 cars involved. Doing so will result in dangerous driving and penalties will be applied.</li><br>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">RACE WILL BE RESTARTED IF THERE IS 3-4 DNFS BEFORE SECTOR 1 ENDS AND ALSO IF 2 DNFS + 4 OR MORE DRIVERS NEED TO CHANGE WING. RACE WILL ONLY BE RESTARTED TWICE UNLESS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE WHOLE GRID HAPPENS. AND IF ANY MAJOR DESYNC ISSUES ARE FOUND ON THE FIRST LAP.</li>
